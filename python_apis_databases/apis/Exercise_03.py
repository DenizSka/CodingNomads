    "first_name": "Deniz",

# json or data works differently: itâ€™s all about the request body.
base_url = "http://demo.codingnomads.co:8080/tasks_api/users"
response1 = requests.post(base_url, json=post_req)
print(response1)

params = {

# params is all about the query string, and so is primarily used on GET requests
response2 = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
